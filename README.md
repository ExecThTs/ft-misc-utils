A directory of all the miscellaneous Lua scripts I wrote for various FamiTracker / 0CC-FamiTracker utilities. Some require [this](https://github.com/HertzDevil/luaFTM) fairly incomplete Lua library for reading / writing FamiTracker modules. Most of these scripts are originally for personal use only; do not expect any commenting or help text in them. They may differ largely in style, and may not even be reusable outside a few contexts.
